## About

This isn't any ordinary sandwich. This is Grant's sandwich. It is *the* sandwich. The sandwich to end all sandwiches. The sandwich that will make you question every sandwich you've ever had before. The sandwich that will make you question every sandwich you will ever have after. This is the sandwich that will make you question the very nature of sandwiches themselves.

I have been making this sandwich and different variations of it for years. It is something that I make for friends, family, and even just myself when I want something that is both comforting and delicious. So many people have asked me for the recipe that I decided to write it down and share it! *Yeah its mostly for you, Fi + Moira + Mom.*

> Note: The ingredients here are just a rough guide. If you add more or less of something, it's not going to ruin the sandwich. It's a sandwich. It's not rocket science.

Time to jump right into it.

## Ingredients

The ingredients are broken down into four categories: the bits, the spread, the fillings, and the bread.

These ingredients should be adequate for 4-6 sandwiches, depending on how much you stuff them.

### The Bits

> Bits are the chopped up things that you toss into the sandwich.

- 1 half of a red onion
- 1 shallot
- 4 cloves of garlic
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- Salt to taste
- Pepper to taste
- Red pepper flakes to taste
- Italian seasoning to taste

### The Spread

> A roasted red pepper and garlic pesto spread

- 1 jar of roasted red peppers, drained
- 3 tablespoons of pistachios
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1/3 cup fresh basil leaves
- 2/3 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, grated
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO)
- Salt to taste

### The Fillings

> The fillings are the main components of the sandwich's interior.

- Chicken breast - seasoned, cooked, and sliced
- Arugula (rocket)
- Provolone cheese
- Sun-dried tomatoes
- Green olives

### The Bread

> The bread is the foundation of the sandwich. Sourdough for a tangy and crispy sandwich, focaccia for a softer and more savory sandwich.

- 1 loaf of sourdough or focaccia bread, your choice

## Instructions

This section will be broken down into two sections, the first is for a TL;DR (too long; didn't read) version of the recipe, and the second is a more detailed version.

### TL;DR

1. Toss everything from "The Bits" into a pan and cook until well browned. Set aside.
2. Blend everything from "The Spread" in a food processor until smooth. Set aside.
3. Slap the chicken breast into a pan, load it with seasonings of your choice, hit it with olive oil, and cook until done. Cut into thin slices. Set aside.
4. Assemble the sandwich:
    1. Spread the pesto onto the bread
    2. Put the chicken on top of the pesto
    3. Add the rest of the "Fillings" and "Bits" on top of the chicken
    4. Close the sandwich
5. Grill the sandwich until the bread is crispy and the cheese is melted and its super hot.
6. Grate some more Parmigiano-Reggiano on top of the sandwich and hit it with some sea salt flakes.
7. Eat the sandwich.

### Detailed

This section will go into detailed instructions (with pictures) on how to make the sandwich.

#### The Bits (Step 1)

First, finely chop up the red onion, shallot, and garlic cloves.

Second, toss the bits into a pan with olive oil, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and Italian seasoning. Cook until well browned.

#### The Spread (Step 2)

First, drain the roasted red peppers.

Then, put the pistachios, garlic cloves, olive oil, salt, fresh basil leaves, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, and roasted red peppers into a food processor.

Blend until smooth. Set it next to your bread for a cool photo.

#### The Fillings (Step 3)

The only thing you really need to do here is cook the chicken breast. Season it with whatever you want, cook it in a pan with olive oil, and slice it up.

I like to put a hefty amount of salt, pepper, rosemary, and paprika on mine. If I have it around, I'll also put some spicy harissa seasoning on it too.

It doesn't really matter all that much what you season it with, just make sure it gets a nice sear on it.

The last bit you need to do here is slice up the sun-dried tomatoes and green olives.

#### Assemble the Sandwich (Step 4)

First, slice up your bread into sandwich-sized pieces. Coat each side with the pesto spread.

Then, lay down the chicken slices on one side of the bread and pop your olives and sun-dried tomatoes on top of the chicken.

Next, put the provolone cheese on top of the olives and sun-dried tomatoes. Then, put the arugula on top of the cheese and sprinkle the bits on top of the arugula.

#### Cook the Sandwich (Step 5)

You can use a panini press, a skillet, or a pan for this. Just make sure you get a nice sear on the bread, the cheese is melted, and the sandwich is hot all the way through.

Ensure that you are cooking your sandwiches on medium heat. You don't want to burn the bread before the cheese melts. Also, use a hefty amount of butter on the bread to get a nice crispy sear.

> A crispy brown sear on the bread is a must. It's the law.

#### Serve the Sandwich (Step 6)

The final step is to grate some more Parmigiano-Reggiano on top of the sandwich and hit it with some sea salt flakes. Slice the sandwich *diagonally* and serve it up.

Enjoy your sandwich!
