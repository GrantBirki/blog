## About

This isn't any ordinary sandwich. This is Grant's sandwich. It is *the* sandwich. The sandwich to end all sandwiches. The sandwich that will make you question every sandwich you've ever had before. The sandwich that will make you question every sandwich you will ever have after. This is the sandwich that will make you question the very nature of sandwiches themselves.

Time to jump right into it.

> Note: The ingredients here are just a rough guide. If you add more or less of something, it's not going to ruin the sandwich. It's a sandwich. It's not rocket science.

## Ingredients

The ingredients are broken down into four categories: the bits, the spread, the fillings, and the bread.

These ingredients should be adequate for 4-6 sandwiches, depending on how much you stuff them.

### The Bits

> Bits are the chopped up things that you toss into the sandwich.

- 1 half of a red onion
- 1 shallot
- 4 cloves of garlic
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- Salt to taste
- Pepper to taste
- Red pepper flakes to taste
- Italian seasoning to taste

### The Spread

> A roasted red pepper and garlic pesto spread

- 1 jar of roasted red peppers, drained
- 3 tablespoons of pistachios
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1/3 cup fresh basil leaves
- 2/3 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, grated
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO)
- Salt to taste

### The Fillings

> The fillings are the main components of the sandwich's interior.

- Chicken breast - seasoned, cooked, and sliced
- Arugula (rocket)
- Provolone cheese
- Sun-dried tomatoes
- Green olives

### The Bread

> The bread is the foundation of the sandwich. Sourdough for a tangy and crispy sandwich, focaccia for a softer and more savory sandwich.

- 1 loaf of sourdough or focaccia bread, your choice

## Instructions

This section will be broken down into two sections, the first is for a TL;DR (too long; didn't read) version of the recipe, and the second is a more detailed version.

### TL;DR

1. Toss everything from "The Bits" into a pan and cook until well browned. Set aside.
2. Blend everything from "The Spread" in a food processor until smooth. Set aside.
3. Slap the chicken breast into a pan, load it with seasonings of your choice, hit it with olive oil, and cook until done. Cut into thin slices. Set aside.
4. Assemble the sandwich:
    1. Spread the pesto onto the bread
    2. Put the chicken on top of the pesto
    3. Add the rest of the "Fillings" and "Bits" on top of the chicken
    4. Close the sandwich
5. Grill the sandwich until the bread is crispy and the cheese is melted and its super hot.
6. Grate some more Parmigiano-Reggiano on top of the sandwich and hit it with some sea salt flakes.
7. Eat the sandwich.
